# FAC-Take-home-challenge-TPX-Impact

## The task and User stories

For this take home challenge we will create a HTML page with a functional stopwatch. The stopwatch must be accurate and have the following features:

- [x] Time display: The current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds)
- [x] Start button: A button to start or continue a timer.
- [x] Pause button: A button to pause the running timer.
- [x] Reset button: A button to reset the timer to zero.

Stretch

- [x]  Lap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.

- [x] Clear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history

- [x] Make it look good

- [x] No bugs or quirky behaviour

- [ ] Any build tools, instructions or other things you think a good project should include
